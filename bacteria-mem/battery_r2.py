battery_r2.py

The round-2 battery: one beekeeping setting, five events (E1-E5), the
situations, recall keys and comprehension checks, all as agreed in
test-conditions.md. battery.py stays as it is for stages A-C.

Each situation has a pred: +1 (rises), -1 (falls), 0 (no change) or None
(measured, not predicted). Meaning items carry the network they reach,
whether they are clean evidence (not also explained by E4's loss), and
whether they are about family or strangers (for the corrosion pattern).

Run the wording check (standard library only):
